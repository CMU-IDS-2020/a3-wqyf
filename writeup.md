## Abstract

NYC Taxi Viz is an interactive data visualization framework that allows the users to explore the traffic flow of NYC taxi. Users can query for specific date, location and time range, as well as choose different types of map layers. The framework also provides the animation function to let users see the dynamic change of traffic flow across time.

## Project Goals

Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.Â 

We aim to develop a tool that allows users to dynamically explore the traffic flow of NYC taxi by user specified date-time and locations.  The users can use the tool to answer the  question: given a specified pick-up location, how the traffic flow bandwidth and direction change overtime. 

## Design

**A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

Query order:
The users will specify the date, then the location, radius, and finally the hour span of the day. 
The location and radius search is potentially expensive and time-consuming. The user will first input a location, then given the location longitude and latitude, we determine all the pick-ups within the radius of the location.  The users can specify the radius to determine the information(detail on demand). 

Specify the date first can potentially greatly reduce the search space for location filtering. Here the trade-off is whether the users will base on the date and then filter for the location or base on the location and filter for the date.  If for the latter,  the location filter should be conducted first to optimize the query speed.  We implemented in both orders and decided to use the first date then the location approach and the hours. We believe the interface provides the best usability. Additionally, the interface allows users to first determine a date and location,  then use the slider bar to explore the hourly traffic flow. 

Date query range:
We allow the users to specify specific date using calendar and hours-span using slider bar. The query condition meets the objective for users to track traffic flow. The users can clearly see the traffic flow for different dates or different hours. For example, the difference of traffic flow between morning time 8:00 am vs night time 11:00 pm or weekdays vs weekends. 

We have experimented with giving users different query choices. For example instead of a specific date, the users can choose a range of days. However, the query choice leads to very large overplot query results which are mostly meaningless from the users' perspective and very expensive for Streamlight to render.  Therefore, we choose to allow users to only query on a specific date. 

Barchart: 
We plot the distribution of the traffic flow based on the user-specfied date. 

Zoom: 
The zoom level is determined dynamically based on the query condition. When the user selects a particular location with a radius, the map will be zoomed to the location given radius range. When the show path option is chosen, the zoom will be set 11 to allow users to clearly see the traffic flow.


Interaction techniques: 
The users can choose two different map layers to show the distribution: HexagonLayer, Heat-map. They also have the option to show the path from pick-up to drop-off. 
We use the color of encoding to represent the estimated speed(using the great circle distance/(pickup time - dropoff time) of the traffic flow, where more green means higher speed and more red means lower speed.  We have experimented with different color encoding combinations, and find out the green and red color encoding is most intuitive and clear. 

Animation rational:
We created the animation for the following reasons. 
1. Users can see the dynamic traffic flow given the specified location and time-span.
2. When the query results are large, the pick-up and drop-off path become intractable for users, so the animation can help breakdown the traffic flow in a mini-scale. 

The animation is set to be 30 frames generated from the selected time span.  
The users can first see the traffic flow for the day to gain a general intutition. If the users see certain traffic flow during certain hours that need more close attention, they can choose to explore the traffic flow in detail using the time slider bar. 

Other UI decisions:
We have two slider bars for users to choose the start and end hours of the day(dynamic query). We have tried with other user input interfaces such as textbox, but the slider bar allows the users to have a better interaction experience.

## Development

**An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

We are a highly collaborative team. After we picked the dataset, we carefully  discussed  and determined the general objective.

Weiqin was in charge of pre-processing data, interactive graphic design of path etc, dynamic filtering using date-time, location,velocity calcuation, interactive graph animation. 

Yifan was in charge of color encoding of taxi path using velocity, dynamic filtering using date-time,  interactive graph animation, design and code structure refinement. 

Each of us spent roughly 25 hours on the project. 

The most time-consuming part was to determine the most effective visual and interactive design so that the audiences can better use our tool.  For example, we have tried to alter the query order, color encoding, layers of map. The experiments were very time-consuming, but it allowed us to better understand and find the best features to have for the tool.
